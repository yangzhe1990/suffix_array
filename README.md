faster than sais. May try to compete kvark's implementation in future.

see compare.txt for benchmark detail. It's listed time consumptions are measured on P8600, which is really old.

i686|x86.benchmark.* shows the benchmark measured on i7-3517U. And the result shows that ka_reduced performs the best!
